      In recent years, and particularly in the wake of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Lives_Matter">#BlackLivesMatter</a> movement after the shooting of Michael Brown, police shootings of Americans have become a major political and contentious issue among the American public. Since police brutality is becoming a hot topic for the 2016 Presidential Election, it is important to be educated about the reality of police shootings, as indicated by the crowdsourced data represented in the map below.
